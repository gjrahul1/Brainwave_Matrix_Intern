                    Coming to the book, for sure it is a romantic thriller or we can say romantic mystery novel . And this will be a guarantee that each page of this book will keep the readers hooked from the very first page to the end of this book.    
                    I was dazzled to see the concept of the author where I can feel both the romance and the mystery moving parallel in this book.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The story line is not only vivid but is set in the wilderness of some uncanny characters who are pretty vile but readers will adore for sure.
                    Pallavi is setting on her adventurous journey of making her life more beautiful and taking that serious revenge upon soon who has never showed any care to her except ignorance.
                    That kiss took a U-turn in Pallavi’s life after which Haasil never appeared to be the love in hr life who will cup her all around into his arms. 
                </p>
                <p>
                     She can’t bear the rejection and hence, that day comes when she encounters someone very close to Haasil and now creates the web of traps for him or may be some other plans to hurt Haasil in her own way.
                      Pallavi may appear vicious or vengeful for the readers at some point of time but trust me there are lots more to know about her and her state of such doings.
                    A roller coaster ride of emotional breakage and Swadha may have done nothing in Pallavi’s life except a very new arrival for her despondent life. What Pallavi does at the end to the very love of her life who she may never forget ?
                 Will Haasil able to know about Palki? Any depicted point of cross-sections between our lovable characters?

                        Author has chosen a very apt topic for today's generation. Everyone will be able to relate to it and more than that they can even learn from it. But the author has not only written about social media but it also has corruption,true love, status of women in India. Even though it has so many topics it never gets overlapping. Each subject is very truly and beautifully connected in the story.
                    </p>
    
                    <p>
                        Story is told through female perspectives. Characters are very well developed. Each character has their own story to tell but you never feel it is too much. You can relate to each female characters. How often men in India take their respective partners for granted!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Plot of the story is very interesting. Graph of the story is very well maintained throughout the book. Every twist and turn just makes you more confused and more intrigued in the story. And I fell in love with the ending. I am generally very cynic when it comes to ending of a thriller book but the ending of this book did not disappoint me at all.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am in love with this book. I have read Novoneel Chakraborty work before and his writing style is quite different from other Indian authors. If you are looking for some Indian thriller books you should definitely checkout his work. I recommend it to everyone.

                            Marry Me, Stranger by Novoneel Chakraborty is an intriguing and gripping psychological thriller that keeps readers on the edge of their seats until the very end. The story follows Rivanah Bannerjee, a young woman who becomes entangled in a mysterious online game of truth and dare with a stranger who calls himself "Stranger." As the dares escalate, Rivanah's life takes a dark and dangerous turn, filled with secrets, suspense, and unexpected twists.

                        <p>
                            A stranger texts her, she replies back..
                            Someone harasses her and she doesn't report..
                            She is the typical example of a beautiful hot girl usually describe everywhere.. The independent image will clash with her. That's I guess interesting point because when we imagine a hard-working woman we specify her to certain traits.. The ones or norms we would follow.. What about a rebellion or who would play around the stranger game and won't apply the block, report option. What happens when we take such a step and how our life goes on a roller roster ride..

                            Chakraborty's writing style is immersive and keeps the readers hooked throughout the book. The character development is well-crafted, allowing readers to connect with the protagonist's emotional journey. The author skilfully weaves a web of suspense, leaving readers guessing the true identity of ’Stranger’ and the motives behind the game.

                        <p>
                            This book has got some kind of unknown thrills. I was so engrossed while reading it and couldn't stop untill completed and even after completion i continued thinking "what happens next?" . 

                            While the book effectively builds tension and explores the darker side of human nature, some readers might find the plot to be somewhat predictable in certain aspects. However, the engaging narrative compensates for any minor drawbacks, making "Marry Me, Stranger" a page-turner that mystery and thriller enthusiasts will enjoy.
                            In conclusion, Marry Me, Stranger is a riveting novel that delves into the realms of obsession, trust, and deception. It is a worthwhile read for those seeking a gripping psychological thriller with a touch of romance and suspense.

                            ALL YOURS , STRANGER is an jaw-dropping mystery & Psychological Thriller story that will have your full attention from page one. A thrilling page turner that will appeal to most audiences. The romance part is ofcourse Sexual , however some part of the story are a bit dark and graphic so I would not recommend this to a younger reader. The writer includes events that a teen had to face emotionally in an extremely new city & present 'em absolutely to pull the story & make it believable.

                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            Coming to Writing Section which is truly hooking till the very last page . As the piece is the 2nd Instalment of the Stranger Series , so it picks up from the threads of Ist Part . Plot hatched with our Protagonist Ravinah travelling to Kolkata , her hometown to excavate information about Hiya Chowdary , whose face was doesn't even remember by her. But reaching home , she found the only evidence placed in her home that can link her to Hiya had been misplaced or intenionally stolen . With nothing concrete , she returned back to Mumbai to her Boyfriend's Place where she get to know Nitya , her Boy friend's best friend , had been living in their flat . Nitya tried to kill herself and as on doctor's advice not to leave her alone , Rivanah found her landed at her place .
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Stranger is proved as a friend as well as a foe for her through out the story . But with my point , Stranger seems to be someone who wants to put Rivanah on the path of Righteous . On pushing Rivanah on the quest to of ' Hiya Chawdry' mystery , Stranger tried to make her feel her true worth . Author had put number of twist in the story which makes it a cliffhanger and makes the journey of reader more like driving in the hills on cutting edge roads . And Like earlier segment , this book holds some realy-really-really-honest WISE WORDS , actally PRACTICAL WISE WORDS & like earlier book , this piece make me note many points in my notes sections . So Ofcourse a MUST READ Groundbreaking instalment of Stranger Series .

Those of you who don't, just know this: I may be killed soon . . . by the Stranger. I don't know who or what he is: a ghost, a person or a figment of my imagination? All I know is he isn't just one thing: he is sexy and scary, terrific and terrifying. What I don't understand is why a young, harmless girl like me, who works in a big city, stays away from her parents and has a screwed-up love life, would be of any interest to him. Unless there is something about my own story that I do not know . . .

                                This book has an element of stream of consciousness and some tacts of epistolar novel has been used. 
                                The author has delineated the incidents perfectly. This book has a tragedy followed by answers to the hidden questions.
                                
                                The style of writing is simple, clear and lucid. Some of the sentences are just so beautiful that you end up noting down in your diary. The descriptions are fantastic and they just make you more glued to the book. Novoneel has a unique style of writing as he ends up playing with the minds of the readers through his play of words.
